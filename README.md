# Eddie

A take on @vzhz's wonderful [Friendly Terminal](https://github.com/vzhz/friendly_terminal) with a [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) spin:

> Eddie is the name of the shipboard computer on the starship Heart of Gold. Like every other system on the spaceship, it has a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Genuine People Personality. Thus, Eddie is over-excitable, quite talkative, over-enthused and extremely ingratiating, or alternatively a coddling, school matron-type as a back-up personality. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_characters#Eddie))_

### And since I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.

I found this repo and forked it from the lovely @victoriadrake.
