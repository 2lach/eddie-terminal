we spend all day in the terminal, so why not have it say nice things to you to start your day off right?

In your .bash_profile, add <code>python3 /Users/<username>/randline.py /Users/<username>/quotes_for_terminal.txt</code>

To create a new .bash_profile, 
(a) navigate to your user folder <code>cd /Users/<username>/</code>
(b) create file with <code>touch .bash_file</code>
(c) open file with your favorite editor and go to town!
